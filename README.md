# Helloworld

This repository is for learning how to use Git by creating a repo and pushing "Hello World" programs.

It was created as part of an assignment to understand Git commands like `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.

## Git Concepts Practiced in This Repository

### 1. **Basic Git Commands**
- Initialized a Git repository (`git init`)
- Added files to staging (`git add`)
- Committed changes (`git commit`)
- Pushed to GitHub (`git push`)

### 2. **Branching and Merging**
- Created multiple branches (`AliceBranch`, `BobBranch`, `CharlieBranch`, `DeniseBranch`, `EsterBranch`)
- Made changes in separate branches
- Merged branches back into `main` (`git merge`)

### 3. **Handling Merge Conflicts**
- Simulated conflicts between `AliceBranch` and `BobBranch`
- Resolved conflicts manually by including both changes

### 4. **Best Practices in Collaboration**
- Ensured changes were pulled before working (`git pull`)
- Merged feature branches properly before committing
- Pushed all branches to GitHub (`git push --all origin`)
